# rust-practice
This repository contains a collection of code snippets written in Rust. These snippets serve as examples and learning materials while exploring the Rust programming language.

## Getting Started
To run these code snippets on your local machine, you need to have Rust installed. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can do so by following the official installation guide: [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
> git clone https://github.com/amancooks08/rust-practice.git

## Structure
The repository has the following structure:
```
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── arrays_slices.rs
│   ├── data_types.rs
│   └── main.rs
└── target
    └── ...
```
The `src` directory contains individual code snippets, each focusing on a specific topic or concept in Rust.

## Running the Snippets
To run the snippets for a particular topic, make sure to *un-comment* the `run()` call for that particular module from the `main.rs` file.
And run the `cargo run` command which will then build and execute the main.rs file.
>You can find and learn about other cargo commands by running `cargo help`.
